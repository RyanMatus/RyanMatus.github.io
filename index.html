						Binoculars is a web app that combines socializing and entertainment, while also letting users discover further content by reducing friction in joining watch/listen parties. Binoculars are used for discovery, whether it be for seeing what your own friends are up to, or also finding new people and content. Recommendations are important, but we do not want users to be suffocated by algorithms deciding what’s best for them. Binoculars allows users to stay within their comfort zone or explore beyond it.<br></br>
						When coming up with ideas for an application, we thought about content consumption since many young adults find themselves watching shows, movies or listening to music when they have free time. Personally, I watch some shows and videos with friends when school was in-person, and I still do some now since I live with a few friends in a house. Having the ability to still share content was important, and also having some sort of human touch to it so that the users don’t get lost in cyberspace too much. I did not like using Zoom much because it is hard to tell where my “virtual body” is. This is when I envisioned a “bubble” concept, similar to this game called agar.io that many of us have played in high school. My peers helped refine the idea and how the bubbles would act and work. We ended up implementing the bubbles as a concept for how users can find and join rooms, and we went from there for integrating more content sharing aspects.<br></br>
						Something else that was important was making sure the recommendations were also present, since people we interviewed said that they like to discover new content from people. As a result, we thought of the dynamic aspect of the positioning of bubbles, and how the closer bubbles could be more “related tastes” to what the user has. I also do not like when algorithms obviously dictate how I use certain products, but I still like it when they give a helping hand. This seemed like a great way where the user is guided by an algorithm, but they can still stray away out of their comfort zone.<br></br>

						The concept and prototypes were created by me, with feedback for the idea and prototype usability from two peers. Made over a 10-week timespan.

						Quarmate is designed for college students to track everyone visiting their home, protecting themselves and their loved ones. Users can input their current test results for other house members to see, as well as register guests in the system with their respective test result. In turn, house members can log visits from guests. This application helps facilitate safe visits from guests and keep track of any potential transmission that could have occurred.<br></br>
						The app is built with React Native and Django. I led the design and did most of the implementation of the front-end, while other peers helped with the back-end. I also helped conduct interviews and user tests to refine the overall focus and interactions. The entire group worked together to make the system design schematics.<br></br>
						See the GitHub repositories for the <a style="font-weight:bolder; color:wheat" href="https://github.com/ryanmatus/quarmate-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">front-end</a> and <a style="font-weight:bolder; color:wheat" href="https://github.com/ryanmatus/quarmate-django" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back-end</a>!<br></br>

						F1 is a very data-driven sport. It is the fastest racing series in the world, and the most international. Many teams work to produce the fastest car they can, and cars are fitted with hundreds of sensors to try to make them faster. Engineering is a huge part of the sport, where teams work to make sense of the data they have in order to get their car to a higher top speed and to corner faster. However, the driver also makes the difference. Each team has two drivers, and driver’s first comparison is often their own teammate. Since every team has different machinery and some are faster than others, comparing oneself to their teammate often offers the most insight on how fast they are comparatively.<br></br>
						For this project, I embarked on analyzing how drivers compare using mainly an Elo-based system, with some other analysis done by non-Elo methods wherever it made sense. Python was used, with full details on the methodology and usage of the data science in the whitepaper.<br></br>

						Raindrop is a smart weather app that intelligently notifies you what the weather will be like and what clothing you should wear (coat, jacket, shorts, etc.) only for drastic weather changes using an algorithm that takes into account entering specific temperature intervals, precipitation and temperature differences between days. If there are no drastic changes in weather, you will not be notified and can assume that you will wear the same thing as you did before. This app is built with Swift and uses the DarkSky API for sourcing the weather information. Additionally, the app has the ability to source carbon emission information and air quality (using a paid API that is currently not active), as well as notifying the user of ways in which they can reduce their carbon emissions. <br></br>

						Hello! I have a passion for using my software engineering experience to create solutions that look and feel great to anyone using them. When I'm not obsessing about colors, I enjoy watching Formula 1 for the spectacle of the cars being engineered to the limit and the drivers having to shave off time in any way they can. I also indulge in graphic design, music production, and fashion as a creative outlet.<br></br>
